                    <p>
                        You agree that any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action
                        (including the interpretation and scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of the
                        controversy, dispute, demand, count, claim, or cause of action) between you and Garnet Discount Shopping shall
                        exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitration. Any such arbitration shall
                        take place in the state and county where you reside subject to the laws of the state of Florida.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state or
                        provincial/territorial arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial
                        arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from a
                        nationally recognized arbitration services such as JAMS pursuant to such organization's standard
                        rules and procedures. The In the case of arbitration and where permitted by law, you are thus
                        agreeing to GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters
                        that you file in small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and
                        NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are
                        SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable
                        as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the case of arbitration and where permitted by law, you and Garnet Discount Shopping must abide
                        by the
                        following rules: (1) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR <span class="text-uppercase">Garnet Discount Shopping</span> MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE
                        PARTY'S
                        INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
                        REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (2) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS,
                        MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT
                        AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (3) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of
                        arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Garnet Discount Shopping will
                        pay as much
                        of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems
                        necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of
                        litigation; (4) Garnet Discount Shopping also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive
                        discretion to assume
                        responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (5) the arbitrator shall honor claims of
                        privilege and privacy recognized at law; (6) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither
                        you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be
                        required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (7) the arbitrator may
                        award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (8)
                        each side pays its own attorneys' fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that
                        requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and, in such
                        instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the applicable law.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the event that a party fails to proceed with Arbitration, unsuccessfully challenges the
                        Arbitrator's award, or fails to comply with the Arbitrator's award, the other party shall be
                        entitled to costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys' fees.
